Code and data for analysis of the British Election Study

R files with "clean" in their name are for data cleaning / merging, typically combining waves of the BES internet panel with relevant economic and demographic data on parliamentary constituencies and local authorities 

R files with "analysis" in their name are for, well, analysis; at the moment I am grouping these by substantive area (hence "localEcon"), but we shall see how long this taxonomy persists 

bes_localEcon_analysis.R is the code for paper 1 of the dissertation. It produces all the tables and figures that are contained in table 1. It uses a cleaned version of the wave 11 data linked to local economic statistics and to some questions contained in wave 12.
